# Data exploration and visualization

So now you've been introduced to `R` and `RStudio` let's get going with some data manipulation and visualization. Exploring and visualising your data is one of the most important steps. It's also one of the simplest!

You'll not find anyone who's not made the mistake of taking their data for granted. Just because someone says it's so **NEVER** trust that that's the case. From typos, to `NA`s, through [-999](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/225175/why-do-some-people-use-999-or-9999-to-replace-missing-values) and let's not even talk dates, your data will always have a surprise in store for you.


## Learning objectives

+ Carry out and interpret the outputs of basic exploratory data analysis using in-built R functions
+ Define data sovereignty and explain this in relation to a researcher's obligation when collecting, displaying, and analysing data
+ Create and communicate informative data visualisations using `R`
+ Discuss and critique data visualisations


## Data wrangling and manipulation

### Introuducing the [Palmer penguins](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090081)



```{r embed, out.extra='style="border: none;"', out.width='40%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_url('https://giphy.com/embed/3og0IO5z8Rd30ktV6g')
```

```{r penguins}
library(palmerpenguins) ## contains some nice penguin data
penguins
```

So, what does this show us?

+ `A tibble: 344 x 8`: A `tibble` is a specific kind of data frame in `R`. The `penguin` dataset has
   + `344` rows (i.e., 344 different observations). Here, each observation corresponds to a penguin.
   + `8` columns corresponding to 3 variables describing each observation.
+ `species`, `island`, `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g`, `sex`, and  `year` are the different variables of this dataset.
+ We then have a preview of the first 10 rows of observations corresponding to the first 10 penguins. ```... with 334 more rows` indicates there are 334 more rows to see, but these have not been printed (likely as it would clog our screen)

To learn more about the penguins read the [paper that talks all about the data collection.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090081)

### Common dataframe manipulations in the `tidyverse`, using `dplyr` and `tidyr`

Even from these first few rows of data we can see that there are some `NA` values. Let's count the number of `NA`s. Remember the `%>%` operator? Here we're going to be introduced to a few new things

  + the `apply()` function,
  + the `is.na()` function, and
  + how `R` deals with `logical` values!

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
penguins %>% 
  apply(.,2,is.na) %>%
  apply(.,2,sum)
```
There's lot going on in that code! Let's break it down

+ Take `penguins` then
+ Use `penguins` as an input to the `apply()` function (this is specified as the first argument using the `.`)
  + Now the `apply()` function takes 3 arguments: 
    1. the data object you want it to *apply* something to (in our case `penguins`)
    2. the margin you want to *apply* that something to; 1 stands for rows and 2 stands for columns, and
    3. the function you want it to apply (in our case `is.na()`).
  + So the second line of code is asking `R` to *apply* the `is.na()` function over the columns of `penguins`
    + `is.na()` asks for each value it's fed is it an `NA` value; it returens a `TRUE` if so and a `FALSE` otherwise
+ The output from the first `apply()` is then fed to the second `apply()` (using the `.`). The `sum()` function then add them up!
    + `R` treats a `TRUE` as a 1 and a `FALSE` as a 0.
    
So how many `NA`s do you think there are!

Doesn't help much. To

Now we know there are `NA` values throughout the data let's remove then and create a new `NA` free version called `penguins_nafree`. There is a really handy `tidyverse` (`dplyr`) function for this!

```{r}
penguins_nafree <- penguins %>% drop_na()
penguins_nafree
```

Below are some other useful manipulation functions; have a look at the out puts and run them yourselves and see if you can work out what they're doing.

```{r}
filter(penguins_nafree, island == "Torgersen" )
summarise(penguins_nafree, avgerage_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm))
group_by(penguins_nafree, species)
```


Often we want to summarise variables by different groups (factors). Below we

+ Take the `penguins_nafree` data then
+ Use this and apply the `group_by()` function to group by `species`
+ Use this output and apply the `summarize()` function to calculate the mean (using (`mean()`) bill length (`bill_length_mm`) of each group (`species`), calling the resulting number `avgerage_bill_length`


```{r}
penguins_nafree %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(avgerage_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm))
```

We can also group by multiple factors, for example, 


```{r}
penguins_nafree %>% 
  group_by(island,species) %>% 
  summarise(avgerage_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm))
```




## Data sovereignty

[''**Data sovereignty** is the idea that data are subject to the laws and governance structures within the nation it is collected''](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sovereignty)

### Two types of plots

1. **For you**
  + data exploration
  + doesn't have to look pretty
  + just needs to get to the point
  
```{r example, me, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
## scatter
ggplot(data = penguins_nafree, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
## histogram
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), alpha = 0.5, position = "identity")
```


 2. **For others**
   + clear purpose
   + designed for the audience
   + make it easy to read (*this covers a lot of things*)
   + do not distort

Plots by Cedric Scherer and mentioned on [this blog](https://jimgruman.netlify.app/post/variableimportance/)

So we've seen some pretty plots, let's get around to making some!

### Introducing `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` is an `R` package for producing statistical, or data, graphics; it has an underlying grammar based on the [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448)

Every `ggplot2` plot has three key components:

  + `data`,

  + A set of `aes`thetic mappings between variables in the data and visual properties, and

  + At least one layer which describes how to render each observation. Layers are usually created with a `geom` function.


#### Plotting `palmerpenguins`

**You might find [this application](https://cmjt.shinyapps.io/penguin/) useful, now and later...**

We've seen that there are three `factor` variables in the dataset: `species`, `island`, and `sex`. To count the number of penguins of each `species` and `sex` on each `island` we could use

```{r count}
penguins_nafree %>%
  count(species, sex, island)
```

Not too easy to compare the numbers here; what about a bar graph (`geom_bar()`)? Based on what we went throuh in the lecture see if you can figure out what each line is adding to the plot. What do you think `facet_wrap()` is doing? To figure it out run the code yourself and try changing some of the lines of code.

```{r bar}
ggplot(penguins_nafree, aes(x = species, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8, position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~island) +
  xlab("") +
  theme_linedraw() + ## remember themes...
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("cyan4","darkorange"), name = "Sex") 
```


We aslo saw there were a few continuous variables, so let's look at scatter plots (`geom_point()`).

```{r point}
ggplot(data = penguins_nafree, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species),size = 2)  +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","darkorchid","cyan4"), name = "") +
  theme_bw() + ## Oo a new theme
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") +
  ylab("Bill length (mm)")
```

What about the *spread*/*distribution* of our continuous vaiables by the factor variables (e.g., `species`):

  + Boxplots (`geom_boxplot()`)? 
  + Violin plots (`geom_violin()`)? 
  + Histograms (`geom_histogram()`)?


In addition,we should always avoid using similarily bight red and green colours: they may not be distinguishable for red-green colorblind readers. Using `ggplot2` we can access a whole range of colourblind friendly palettes: one package that has a whole range is `RColorBrewer` install it then try running `RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all(colorblindFriendly = TRUE)` what do you think you've asked your compueter to show you?


```{r, message=FALSE}
## boxplot
ggplot(penguins_nafree,aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    ylab("Flipper length (mm)") + xlab("") +
  theme_classic() ## yet another theme
## violin plot
ggplot(penguins_nafree,aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
    geom_violin() +
    ylab("Flipper length (mm)") + xlab("") +
    theme_minimal() ## soon you could be making your own
## histogram, with a colorblind friendly palette
## try running display.brewer.all(colorblindFriendly = TRUE)
## what do you think it's doing
ggplot(penguins_nafree,aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
    xlab("Flipper length (mm)") + 
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2", name = "Species") +
  theme_light()

```


#### What do we think about when we look at plots

Between group variation

```{r, echo = FALSE}
means <- penguins_nafree %>% group_by(species) %>% summarise(means = mean(bill_length_mm))
mean <- mean(penguins_nafree$bill_length_mm)
means$ends <- mean
means$lag1 <- means$means[c(2,3,1)]
means$lag2 <- means$means[c(3,1,2)]
ggplot(penguins_nafree,aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
    geom_violin()  + 
  ylab("Bill length (mm)") +
  xlab("Species") +
   geom_point(data = means, aes(x = species, y = means),color = "blue", size = 2) +
annotate(geom = 'text', label = "Average bill length per species" , x = -Inf, y = Inf, hjust = 0, vjust = 1.2, color = "blue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean, color = "red") +
  annotate(geom = 'text', label = "Overall average bill length" , x = -Inf, y = Inf, hjust = 0, vjust = 3, color = "red") +
  geom_segment(data = means, aes(x = species, y = means, xend = species, yend = ends),col = "darkgreen", size = 2)  +
  annotate(geom = 'text', label = "Differences to overall average" , x = -Inf, y = Inf, hjust = 0, vjust = 5, color = "darkgreen") +
  geom_hline(data = means, aes(yintercept = means), color = "blue", alpha = 0.3, lty = 2) + 
  geom_segment(data = means, aes(x = as.numeric(species) - 0.15, y = means, 
                                 xend = as.numeric(species) - 0.15, yend = lag1),col = "purple", size = 2) +
  geom_segment(data = means, aes(x = as.numeric(species) + 0.15, y = means, 
                                 xend = as.numeric(species) + 0.15, yend = lag2),col = "purple", size = 2)+
  annotate(geom = 'text', label = "Differences between groups" , x = -Inf, y = Inf, 
           hjust = 0, vjust = 7, color = "purple")
```
Within group variation

```{r,echo = FALSE}
jit <- ggplot() + 
  geom_jitter(data = penguins_nafree,aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm, color = species), alpha = 0.2) 

penguins_nafree$x_points <- layer_data(jit)$x
penguins_nafree$y_points <- layer_data(jit)$y
penguins_nafree <- penguins_nafree %>% group_by(species) %>% mutate(sp_means = mean(bill_length_mm))

ggplot() + 
  ylab("Bill length (mm)") +
  xlab("Species") +
  geom_point(data = means, aes(x = species, y = means, color = species), size = 2) +
  geom_text(data = means, aes(x = species, y = means + 2.5, color = species, 
                              label = paste0("Species average = ",round(means,3)))) +
  geom_hline(data = means, aes(yintercept = means, color = species), alpha = 0.3, lty = 2) +
  geom_point(data = penguins_nafree,aes(x = x_points, y = y_points, color = species), alpha = 0.2) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  geom_segment(data = penguins_nafree, aes(x = x_points, y = y_points, xend = x_points, 
                                 yend = sp_means,color = species), size = 1, alpha = 0.2) 
```
