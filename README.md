|  4 | Charlotte | Linear models continued (multiple variables and interpretation)	lms continued.  | Multi factor designs (what you’d traditionally call ANOVA)  |
|  5 | Charlotte  | Interpret a p-value! (model interpretation and comparison)	  |  P-value week! Model critique and comparison |
|  6 | Charlotte  | But what if we have lots and lots of data? (introduction to clustering and dimensionality reduction)  | Clustering... and MDS…   |
|  7 | Nobuto |  forward modelling in general | growth models	exponential / logistic growth (& exponents, logarithms, etc.)  |
