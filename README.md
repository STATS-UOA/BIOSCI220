Repo for the statistical material for BIOSCI220, semester 1 2020.

**Teaching team**

 + Charlotte M. Jones-Todd [c.jonestodd@auckland.ac.nz](c.jonestodd@auckland.ac.nz)

 + Nicole Cloonan [n.cloonan@auckland.ac.nz](n.cloonan@auckland.ac.nz)

**Dates**: 28th April--29th May (weeks 7--11)

**Labs**. Lecture material is provided online.  Lab attendance is not compulsory. Students must sign up for one lab (in which they are guaranteed a space), but may attend more than one lab per week, space permitting. Any student may attend any tutorial session (immediately after the lab).

 + Tuesday: Lab 2--4pm, Tutorial 4--5pm.
 + Wednesday: Lab 10am--12pm, Tutorial 12--1pm.
 + Thursday: Lab 2--4pm, Tutorial 4--5pm.


**Week 7**: Experimental design.

**Week 8**: Visualising and analysing multivariate data.

**Week 9**: Hypothesis testing.

**Week 10**: Introduction to linear modelling.

**Week 11**: Modelling II.

Students are expected to have basic statistical literacy for this course (e.g., STATS101 level). Students are expected to:

  
1. Identify the following types of variables in the dataset
  
  + factor
  + continuous
  + categorical
  
2. Write their own R code to summarise each variable using an appropriate plot. Specifically be able to produce the following plots
 
  + boxplot
  + scatter plot
  + histogram
  + barplot
  
3. Represent their data as a clean data frame in R and manipulate it accordingly.
4. Communicate a summary of the dataset accurately and concisely
5. Communicate any limitations relevant to the dataset
