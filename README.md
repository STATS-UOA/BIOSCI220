Students are expected to have basic statistical literacy for this course (e.g., STATS101 level). Students are expected to:

  
1. Identify the following types of variables in the dataset
  
  + factor
  + continuous
  + categorical
2. Write their own R code to summarise each variable using an appropriate plot. Specifically be able to produce the following plots
 
  + boxplot
  + scatter plot
  + histogram
  + barplot
3. Represent their data as a clean data frame in R and manipulate it accordingly.
4. Communicate a summary of the dataset accurately and concisely
5. Communicate any limitations relevant to the dataset
