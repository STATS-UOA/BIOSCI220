|  1 | All  | Course intro/lecturers/goals (Charlotte remainder)  | (optional) R & Rstudio installation / terminology  |
|  2 | Charlotte/1  | Data visualization (incl. multivariate) and wrangling  | importing data into R. Introduction to what a “package” is. Data viz and data wrangling (minimal)  |
|  3 | Charlotte/1  | Experimental design and introduction to linear models (the idea of a single response)	  |  	Experimental design and single response (traditionally referred to as a t-test etc) |
|  4 | Charlotte/1 | Linear models continued (multiple variables and interpretation)	lms continued.  | Multi factor designs (what you’d traditionally call ANOVA)  |
|  5 | Charlotte/1  | Interpret a p-value! (model interpretation and comparison)	  |  P-value week! Model critique and comparison |
|  6 | Charlotte/1  | But what if we have lots and lots of data? (introduction to clustering and dimensionality reduction)  | Clustering... and MDS…   |
|  7 | Nobuto/2 |  forward modelling in general | growth models	exponential / logistic growth (& exponents, logarithms, etc.)  |
