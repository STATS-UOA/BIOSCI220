## Key Topics

### Module I. Data Exploration and Statistical Inference

+ Data wrangling and visualization. Introduction to R, importing and plotting data, R packages
+ Experimental design and introduction to linear models
+ Linear models with multiple variables; interpretation; ANOVA
+ Interpretation of p-values; model critique and model comparison
+ Large data, exploratory data analysis, introduction to clustering and dimensionality reduction

### Module II. Biological modelling

+ Forward modelling in general; what we can learn from models of biological processes; introduction to
growth models
+ The SIR model (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) as an example model highly relevant to medicine
(epidemiology, COVID-19), similar to ecology population models, relevant to evolution (birth-death
processes)
+ Modelling the evolution of virulence

### Module III. Model-based inference, and critical thinking about models

+ Model-based inference, parameter inference with Maximum Likelihood, fitting curvilinear models
+ Statistical model comparison, using the principle of parsimony to penalise more complex models (with
AIC). Fitting SIR models to real-world SARS-CoV-2 data.
+ The crucial role of models in science & society; critical thinking about models, inference, and public policy.
