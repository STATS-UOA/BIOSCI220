\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Assessed quiz on CANVAS worth 1\% of your final grade (Practise quiz here)}

\subsection*{Lab---peer assessed worth 6\% of your final grade}

\begin{itemize}
\item In groups discuss the experiments covered in these articles. Identify the following.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item explanatory variable
  \item response variable
  \item treatment 
  \end{itemize}
\item Discuss the experimental design. For example, is randomisation, blinding, placebo, or matched pair design, used in the experiment?
\item Discuss potential flaws of the experiments. For example are there any confounding or interacting variables?
  \item Each group will then be paired with another. In turns---in each pair---one group will present thoughts on the studies design, results, and flaws to the other and be assessed anonymously according to these (**TODO link assessment sheet**) criteria.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Week 8 (beginning 4th May): Visualising and analysing multivariate data}
\subsection*{Learning objectives}
By the end of this lab student should be able to
\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss the aims and motivations of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and its relevance in biology
\item List and summarise the three main types of MDS:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item classical MDS
  \item metric MDS
  \item non-metric MDS
  \end{itemize}
\item Write R code to create an MDS plot appropriate to the given dataset
\item Interpret an MDS plot
\item Explain the aims and motivation behind Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its relevance in biology 
\item Write R code to carry out PCA
  \item Interpret the effectively communicate the output of a PCA 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Mini lectures}

\begin{itemize}
\item Intro to MDS and scaling
\item When the distances are Euclidean (PCA \& bread)
\item Carrying out and drawing inference PCA in `R`
\item Lab tutorial explained (PCA cheatsheet)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Labs 9--11 will be assessed via a one page Executive Summary due 11.59pm on the 31st May 2020.}

This Executive Summary will be worth  18\% of your final grade and is in addition to he weekly CANVAS quiz. During lab time you are free to work through the material provided and your final report. You may work in groups, however, the final report must be your \textbf{own} work. Any plagiarism will automatically result in 0\% for the report. Your Executive Summary should be no more than one A4 page. If should concisely effectively communicate your hypothesis, the statistical analysis undertaken, and your findings. Here are some guidelines to follow when writing your executive summary
\begin{itemize}
\item  It should \textbf{not} contain any statistical terminology that would only be properly understood by a statistician
  \item Recall there are a set of main messages that you should report from your analysis, the reader doesn't need to know about all the work you carried out
\item A brief outline of an Executive Summary should follow the sections listed below
  \begin{itemize}
\item Introduction: a one or two sentence description of the data and the purpose of the analysis
\item Methods: important \textbf{non technical} information for the reader about the analysis carried out
\item Report findings and the strength of evidence for them
\item Quantification: how reliable/generalisable are those findings
  \item Summary: a one or two sentence summary of the major findings
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Week 9 (beginning 11th May): Hypothesis testing}


\subsection*{Learning objectives}
By the end of this lab student should be able to
\begin{itemize}
\item List appropriate questions posed by the biological questions and  outline an appropriate hypothesis test that would answer it
\item Describe the aims of the following hypothesis tests
  \begin{itemize}
  \item one-sample t-test
  \item two-sample t-test
  \item randomization test
  \end{itemize}
\item List the aims of hypothesis testing and write out the appropriate null and alternative hypothesis using statistical notation
\item Write R code to carry out an hypothesis test using the appropriate variables in their dataset. Specifically write R code to carry out
  \begin{itemize}
  \item one-sample t-test
  \item two-sample t-test
  \item randomization test
  \end{itemize}
\item Interpret and communicate the findings of an hypothesis test accurately and concisely
\item List the limitations of the hypothesis in relation to the questions posed by the data
\end{itemize}
