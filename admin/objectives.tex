\subsection*{Learning objectives}
By the end of this lab student should be able to
\begin{itemize}
  \item Identify the independent and dependent variable in an experiment
\item Describe the setup of the following experimental designs
  \begin{itemize}
  \item independent measures
  \item repeated measures
  \item matched pairs
  \end{itemize}
\item Identify the type of design used in the given case studies
\item Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different design types
\item Critique experimental designs used in the the given case studies
\item Design an experiment that follows good experimental design principles
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Mini lectures}

\begin{itemize}
\item What is experimental design?
\item Variable types
\item Experiment validity
\item Types of experimental design
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Lab}

\begin{itemize}
\item In groups discuss the experiments covered in these articles. Identify the following.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item explanatory variable
  \item response veriable
  \item treatment 
  \end{itemize}
\item Discuss the experimental design. For example, is randomisation, blinding, placebo, or matched pair design, used in the experiment?
\item Discuss potential flaws of the experiments. For example are there any confounding or interacting vaiables?
\item \textbf{Design and carry out your own experiment}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use this tool to test your reaction time.
  \item Does size of the character affect your reaction time?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Week 8 (beginning 4th May): Visualising and analysing multivariate data}
\subsection*{Learning objectives}
By the end of this lab student should be able to
\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss the aims and motivations of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and its relevance in biology
\item List and summarise the three main types of MDS:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item classical MDS
  \item metric MDS
  \item non-metric MDS
  \end{itemize}
\item Write R code to create an MDS plot appropriate to the given dataset
\item Interpret an MDS plot
\item Explain the aims and motivation behind Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its relevance in biology 
\item Write R code to carry out PCA
  \item Interpret the effectively communicate the output of a PCA 
\end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item one-sample t-test
  \item two-sample t-test
  \item randomization test
  \end{itemize}
\item List the aims of hypothesis testing and write out the appropriate null and alternative hypothesis using statistical notation
\item Write R code to carry out an hypothesis test using the appropriate variables in their dataset. Specifically write R code to carry out
  \begin{itemize}
  \item one-sample t-test
  \item two-sample t-test
  \item randomization test
  \end{itemize}
\item Interpret and communicate the findings of an hypothesis test accurately and concisely
\item List the limitations of the hypothesis in relation to the questions posed by the data
