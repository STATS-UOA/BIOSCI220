# Introdution to `R` and `RStudio`.

The purpose of this chapter is to get you started learning a new language! Throughout BIOSCI220 you will be introduced to tools  required to critically analyse and interpret biological data, and processing into biological information.

Following each step of this chapter carefully you are expected to install `R` and `RStudio` onto your computers as each week you will be expected to carry out a little programming! 

## Learning Objectives

+ Define the difference between `R` and `RStudio`
+ Distinguish between different data types (e.g., integers, characters, binary, numerical)
+ Explain what an `R` function is; describe what an argument to an `R` function is
+ Explain what an `R` package is; distinguish between the functions `install.packages()` and `library()`
+ Use the appropriate `R` function to read in a `.csv` data; carry out basic exploratory data analysis using in-built `R` functions
