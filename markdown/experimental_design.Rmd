## Dependent and independent variables


How do controllable inputs (treatment factors/independent variable) impact outcomes of interest (responses/dependent variable)?

```{r ivdv, fig.height=10,fig.width=10}
d <- data.frame(y = rep(3:1,times = c(6,1,3)),x = c(-1,-0.1,0.1, 0.9,1,1.1,0,-1,0,1))
ggplot(d,aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_emoji(data = d[1:6,],emoji = "1f4a7",size = 0.05) + geom_emoji(data = d[7,],emoji = "1f4cf",size = 0.1) +
  geom_emoji(data = d[8,],emoji = "1f331",size = 0.1) + geom_emoji(data = d[9,],emoji = "1f33f",size = 0.1) +
  geom_emoji(data = d[10,],emoji = "1f333",size = 0.1) + 
  theme_void() + xlim(c(-2,2)) + ylim(c(-1,4)) +  
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = 2.5, label = " The independent variable represents a \n quantity that is being manipulated (e.g., amount of water)") +  
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = 1.5, label = " The dependent variable represents a quantity \n that depends on the independent variable (e.g., height of plant)")

```

## A simple design: Independent measures (between subjects)

Separate groups are created for each treatment (i.e., each participant is assigned to only one treatment group); participants can only be a member of **one** of the groups

```{r independent,message=FALSE,cache=TRUE,results='hide'}
plot(1:15, rep(1,15),col = rep(1:3,each = 5),pch = 20,axes = FALSE, xlab = "",ylab = "",cex = 4);
legend("topleft",bty = "n",pch = 20, col = 1:3, legend = c("Group 1","Group 2", "Control"))

```

**Advantages**

 + simple design setup
 + multiple treatments can be tested at the same time
 + quick
    
**Disadvantages**

  + each participant is only being tested once
  + complex if more than a few treatments are being tested
  + differences in individuals may skew results
  + bias (selection or accidental) can be an issue 
    

## Fisher's principles of experimental design


### Randomization

Plan the experiment in such a way that the variations caused by extraneous factors can all be combined under the general heading of "chance".


```{r flip,message=FALSE,cache=TRUE,results='hide'}
pngs <- list.files("../gifs/","coin.png",full = TRUE)
imgs <- lapply(pngs,png::readPNG)
ani.options(interval = 0.5)
dir <- getwd()
setwd("../gifs")
saveGIF(
    for(i in 1:2){
        plot(1,type = "n", axes = FALSE,xlim = c(-0.6,0.6),xlab ="",ylim = c(-0.6,0.6),ylab = "")
        rasterImage(imgs[[i]],-0.5,-0.5,0.5,0.5)
    },movie.name = "flip.gif"
)
setwd(dir)
```

![](../gifs/flip.gif)

**Advantages** 
  
  + ensures that each treatment has the same
probability of getting good (or bad) units and thus
avoids systematic bias
    + random allocation can cancel out population bias; it ensures that any other possible causes for the experimental results are split equally between groups
    + typically statistical analysis assumes that observations are
independent. This is almost never strictly true in practice
but randomisation means that our estimates will behave
as if they were based on independent observations


### Replication (repeated measures  or within groups)

**An experiment should be repeated more than once**

We should repeat an experiment to fully assess variability and enable us to (with caution) generalize results. For true replication the entire process must be repeated separately each time.

```{r repeated,message=FALSE,cache=TRUE,results='hide'}
plot(1:15, rep(1.5,15),col = rep(1:3,each = 5),pch = 17,axes = FALSE, xlab = "",ylab = "",cex = 3,ylim = c(0,2.5))
points(1:15,rep(1,15),col = rep(1:3,each = 5),pch = 18,cex = 3)
points(1:15,rep(0.5,15),col = rep(1:3,each = 5),pch = 19, cex = 3)
legend("topleft",bty = "n",pch = 17:19, col = "grey", legend = paste("Treatment", 1:3))
legend("topright",bty = "n",pch = 20, col = 1:3, legend = paste("Patient", 1:3))

```


  **Advantages** 
  
  + variability between subjects already controlled for
    + we can estimate the inherent variability in the data from the replicate observations
    + allows us to judge whether an observed difference could be due to chance
variation
    
  **Disadvantages**
  
  + possibility that the position of the treatment in the order of treatments matters
    + randomization can correct for this.
  + carryover effects (i.e., one part of the experiment can have trickle down effects to subsequent parts)
  + death or dropout of subjects 







### Blocking

#### Randomised block design 


Blocking helps control variability by making treatment groups more alike. Experimental units are divided into subsets (called
blocks) so that units within the same block are more similar than units from different subsets or blocks. 

In a randomized block design, the researcher divides experimental subjects into homogeneous blocks. Treatments are then randomly assigned to the blocks. The variability within blocks should be greater than the variability between blocks. In other words, you need to make sure that the blocks contain subjects that are very similar. 


```{r random block,echo = FALSE}
block <- rep(1:4, each = 4)
set.seed(4321)
treatment <- c(replicate(4,sample(1:4,size = 4)))
plot(1:16,rep(1,length(block)),col = block,pch = treatment + 14,axes = FALSE,xlab = "",ylab = "",cex = 3)
legend("topright",bty = "n", pch = 15:18, legend = paste("Treatment",1:4), col = "grey")
legend("topleft",bty = "n", pch = 20, col = 1:4, legend = paste("Block",1:4))

```


**Advantages**

  + if two units in the same block get different treatments
the treatments can be compared more precisely than if
the treatments were assigned to units in different blocks
  + blocking allows us to increase our ability to detect
differences without increasing the size of the
experiment

   <!-- 2. Design your own experiment  -->

<!-- In groups you give yourselves half an hour to design and carry out your own experiment using an online game. Here are links to some possible games you could use and some research questions you might want to answer (in this lab)! -->

<!--   + [Google Quick Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) -->
<!--       + Does AI recognise the drawing quicker than a real person? -->
<!--       + Are people who play musical instruments better at drawing for the AI? -->
<!--       + Does the complexity of the object affect how quickly it is recognised by the AI? -->
<!--   + [Reaction Time Test](https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime) -->
<!--       + Are people who play sports regularly faster to react? -->
<!--       + Are people without a car license slower to react? -->




Each group should then pair up with another group and present the design, results, and flaws of [this study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077193). This should be done **as a group** and the presentation should last no more than 5 minutes. In this exercise you will be peer reviewed so in your pairs of groups you **must** [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMZDLBiDVTNzoKR7vAZmHLflN0qcIfFeowIuNclvgDLfDBjg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
