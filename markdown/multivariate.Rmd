## Learing Objectives

By the end of this lab student should be able to

   + Discuss the aims and motivations of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and its relevance in biology
   + List and summarise the three main types of MDS:
      + classical MDS
      + metric MDS
      + non-metric MDS
   + Write R code to create an MDS plot appropriate to the given dataset
   + Interpret an MDS plot
   + Explain the aims and motivation behind Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its relevance in biology
   + Write R code to carry out PCA
   + Interpret the effectively communicate the output of a PCA

## Suggested reading

## MDS (minimizes dimensions, preserving distance between data points)

## PCA (minimizes dimensions, preserving covariance of data).

#### PCA is the same as MDS if the distances used in MDS are Euclidean

# Example and `R` code

```{r read in data}
data <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacarpentry/wrangling-genomics/gh-pages/files/Ecoli_metadata_composite.csv"))
## data structure
str(data)
```
