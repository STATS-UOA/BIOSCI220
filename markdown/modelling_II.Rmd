## Learing Objectives

By the end of this lab student should be able to

   + Write R code to fit a linear model with interaction terms in the explanatory variables
   + Interpret estimated effects with reference to confidence intervals from linear regression models. Specifically the interpretation of
      + main effects in a model with an interaction
      + the effect of one variable when others are included in the model
   + Explain why you may want to include interaction effects in a linear model
   + Describe the differences between the operators : and * in an R model-fitting formula
   + Critique the fitted model
